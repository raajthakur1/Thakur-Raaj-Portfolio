## Physical Vulnerabilities Relevant to a Pharmaceutical Research Company {.collapsible}

In a facility with highly confidential information such as a pharmaceutical research company, physical security is of the upmost importance. Common vulnerabilties that companies may overlook include:

- Unrestricted access to spaces with sensitive information (such as research or financial information)
    - This vulnerability would exist in confidential facilities within the campus such as research labs and the admin wing with financial documents, and presents severe risk since it allows unauthorized people to access highly confidential and valuable information even though they shouldn't be able to
- Lack of security cameras in secure areas or in hallways leading to secure areas
    - This vulnerability, similarly to the previous one, would exist near confidential facilities. This vulnerability presents a risk since it does not allow the security team to know when people entered or exited the secure area or where in the building they are coming from.
- Unsecured network closets that leave network infrastructure exposed
    - This vulnerability would exist 
- Lack of night vision cameras to help monitor areas even when it is dark
- Short fence that can easily be climbed
- Lack of biometric authentication to enter the campus
