## Course Overview

AP Networking is an AP Career Kickstart™ course that teaches students how to configure network hardware, use protocols to enable reliable and accurate transmission of data, and to protect the transmission of data within and between computer networks. 

#### Technical skills learned include:

- Designing a secure network:
    - Determining appropriate endpoints, network appliances, transmission media, and communication protocols to meet network requirements  
    - Enabling reliable, accurate, and secure transmission in the context of the OSI and TCP/IP models  
- Configuring a secure network:
    -  Constructing, connecting, and documenting network components using appropriate media, communication protocols, and commands  
    - Troubleshooting common issues by testing connectivity, verifying configuration, and monitoring congestion  
- Protecting computer networks:
    - Identifying potential vulnerabilities in data, devices, and networks  
    - Implementing security controls that address potential vulnerabilities
