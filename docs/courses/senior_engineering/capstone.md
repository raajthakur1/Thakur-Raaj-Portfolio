# Capstone
For the majority of the year, I worked towards completing my capstone project: a fully custom-designed 3D printed drone with custom electronics and AI-powered object classification, pose tracking, facial recognition, and more. 

## Build Goals
From the start, I wanted my drone to do the following:

- Have a long battery life
- Be able to record video in at least 1080p
- Have high processing power for AI-powered tasks
- Custom design as much as possible
