Today, I continued work on my wooden pen. I took my two blocks of wood and turned them on a lathe. I took a chisel and removed material until the blocks were cylindrical, and when they got to the desired thickness, I used fine grit sandpaper to smooth the two blocks. Now, I have the two wooden components for my pen ready, and now, I can assemble the pen and do all of the finishing touches next class.

Today, I finished my pen. I started off by using the pen press to:

- Press the pen tip into the bottom end of the lower barrel 
- Press the ink chamber into the top end of the lower barrel
- Press the clip assembly into the top end of the upper barrel

Once I pressed these components, I could assemble the main sections together. I screwed the ink refill into the ink chamber, slid the ring onto the chamber above the lower barrel, and slid the upper barrel above the ring. Once I did that, my pen was done, and it wrote super well, along with looking very cool.
