## About Me

![Raaj's Picture](media/picture.JPG){ width=250 }

Hello! My name is Raaj, and welcome to my Book to Box Office Portfolio, where I share all of the major assignments I have completed throughout the course. I am a senior with a very strong interest in engineering. When I was really young, I became very interested with cars, which sparked my interest in engineering. To this day, I am super passionate about engineering and cars.

Another interest I have had since a young age is reading. I enjoy reading a variety of genres, but my favorite is nonfiction. Some of my favorite books include:

- *Mindset* by Dr. Carol S. Dweck
- *Atomic Habits* by James Clear
- *Can't Hurt Me* by David Goggins
- The *Percy Jackson* series of books by Rick Riordan

Additionally, I enjoy watching movies. Some of my favorite movies include:

- *Ford v Ferrari*, directed by James Mangold
- *Gran Turismo*, directed by Neill Blomkamp
- *Captain America: Civil War*, directed by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo
- *Shrek*, directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson

Since I am interested in both books and movies, I chose to take Book to Box Office since I thought it would be interesting to see how the nuances of books are represented in film. My favorite book/film combo that we studied this semester was text and film adaptations of *The Princess Bride*, written and directed by William Goldman and Rob Reiner, respectively (read more on this on the [***The Princess Bride Paper***](princess_bride.md) page). I found it really interesting how Reiner was able to visually represent the unique structure of the text through a framing device. 

In the future, I plan to pursue engineering, since it has been my passion for the majority of my life. I have applied to many schools, and although I have not heard back from most of them, I have already been accepted to Clemson University, a school with a very strong engineering program.
