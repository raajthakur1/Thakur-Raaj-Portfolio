# *Wiseguy*/*Goodfellas* Journal #1

## Prompt

The prompt for this journal was:

"Think about Pileggi’s concept of 'family,' and what he thinks that must mean for Hill and Hill’s associates. What is your takeaway, based on what you have read thus far, and why is this important?"

## Response

Pileggi’s concept of “family” is centered around trust and loyalty rather than blood. Although Henry Hill is not biologically related to any of the mobsters and is not even fully Italian-American, he views the mob as his family because he knows he can trust them and that they are loyal to each other. Henry doesn’t have a strong relationship with his father, and instead of seeing him as a role model, he sees the mobsters as a role model due to their strong bond. Their relationship is created through loyalty, trust, and respect.
