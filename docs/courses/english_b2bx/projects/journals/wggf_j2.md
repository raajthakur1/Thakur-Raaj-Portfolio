# *Wiseguy*/*Goodfellas* Journal #2

## Prompt

The prompt for this journal was:

"Martin Scorsese once said, 'Authenticity in storytelling lies in capturing the truth of human imperfections and complexities.'" 

In Wiseguy and Goodfellas, we encounter language that includes profanity, racial, ethnic, and religious slurs, and other offensive terms. These words are not used casually by the authors or filmmakers, but instead are part of depicting a specific world—one rooted in crime, loyalty, power, and identity. These words can be uncomfortable, shocking, and harmful—and that is part of why they matter.

Write in first person about your response to this kind of language in the book and the film. 

## Response

I think that Nicholas Pileggi and Martin Scorsese chose to include harsh and vulgar language throughout the novel/film in order to immerse the reader/viewer in a truly authentic representation of Henry Hill’s life rather than not representing aspects of mob life as they truly are. The profanities, slurs, and other vulgar language are used by the mobsters in real life, and to portray them as being well spoken and cautious with their words would be inaccurate and misleading, and neither Pileggi nor Scorsese would want that to happen. Also, the use of profane language by the mobsters showcases their power and how non-mobsters are scared to tell them anything. If anyone else was as loud and used language as profane as them in a public space like a restaurant, they would likely get kicked out. However, since the mobsters are so feared, nobody dares to say anything to them.
