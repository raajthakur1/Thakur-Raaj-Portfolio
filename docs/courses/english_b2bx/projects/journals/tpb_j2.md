# *The Princess Bride* Journal #2

## Prompt

Before watching Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride, imagine how a filmmaker might bring William Goldman’s layered story to the screen. You already know how the novel blurs fantasy and reality through the “book within a book” structure, the interruptions from Goldman, and the exaggerated fairy-tale tone.

- For this journal, predict how the movie might handle those metafictional elements.How might a director visually or narratively show the story-within-a-story structure?
- What might the mise-en-scène (the look and feel of the setting, costumes, and lighting) communicate about tone and genre?
- How do you imagine the performance style of characters like Westley, Buttercup, or Inigo will shape your understanding of them compared to how you imagined them while reading?
- What might be challenging or impossible to show on screen?

Conclude with a prediction: what will the overall mood of the film be—more like an epic adventure, a parody, or a fairy-tale romance?
