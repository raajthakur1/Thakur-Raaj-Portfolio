# *Wiseguy* / *Goodfellas* Paper

## Prompt

For the *Wiseguy* / *Goodfellas* paper, the class was given a variety of prompts to choose from. I chose the following prompt:

Prompt #8: The Seduction and the Cost of Mob Life
In *Wiseguy* and *Goodfellas*, Nicholas Pileggi and Martin Scorsese both show how the mob offers glamour, loyalty, and power—but also destruction and loss. Write an essay analyzing how Scorsese uses at least two film techniques (such as mise en scène, cinematography, sound, performance, or editing) to highlight both the attraction and the downfall of mob life. How does this compare with Pileggi’s written presentation of the same theme?
