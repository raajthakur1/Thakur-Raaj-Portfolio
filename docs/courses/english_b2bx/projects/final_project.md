# Final Project

The task for the final project was to analyze a text/film pairing that was previously studied in this course, such as:

- *Wiseguy* / *Goodfellas*
- "8:00 in the Morning" / *They Live*
- *The Princess Bride* (Book) / *The Princess Bride* (Film) (**This one was chosen**)
- "It Had to be Murder" / *Rear Window*

For the format of the project, there were many different choices. Along with two peers, we decided to create a 6-10 minute podcast comparing *The Princess Bride*'s text and film versions, specifically focusing on what the film improves compared to the text.
