The project included various small activities to help us learn, including: - Silent Signals - Metal to Magic - A Component Song Silent Signals Silent Signals was the first part of the project. In this activity, my partner and I each received a 3D printed card with a white side and a blue side, and our goal was to communicate various messages with each other solely with the cards, and without any kind of gesturing or speaking. From the start, we knew that we needed to establish some kind of standardized method of communication with each other. We mutually decided that to communicate numbers, we should use the card to tap the desk to represent the quantity of the number, and for boolean questions (yes/no, A/B, etc.) that we needed to assign one color to option 1 and the other color to option 2. Unfortunately, we couldn't talk, so we ended up picking different colors than each other. After trying out my system with partners, our new goal was to design a communication system to communicate the following information without gestures or speaking: The number 3 The month October \u201cYes\u201d to a yes/no question My plan for this was to: Start by tapping the table thrice to communicate the integer value of 3 Waiting a bit, then tapping the table 10 times to communicate October, since it's the 10th month Lastly, to communicate \"yes\" to a yes/no question, I would show the white side of the card. Although there's no way to guarantee that my partner would know white means yes, if you think about the card as an on/off switch, white would likely be \"on\" since it's light, and blue would be \"off\" since it's darker. Therefore, white would signify \"yes.\" This method required a bit of luck that my partner would understand what I was trying to communicate, since there was no way to actually talk with him to tell him what each color meant.","title":"Component Cards & Software Slips"},{"location":"courses/ap_networking/component-cards-and-software-slips/#component-cards-software-slips","text":"","title":"Component Cards &amp; Software Slips"},{"location":"courses/ap_networking/component-cards-and-software-slips/#project-introduction","text":"Component Cards and Software Slips was the first project of the year, and was designed to teach us about the various hardware and software components of a PC, and to teach us about how they all worked together.
